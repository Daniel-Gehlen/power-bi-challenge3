**Methods:**
To perform the data analysis, the following steps were followed:

1. **Data Treatment:**
   - Checked and corrected headers and data types.
   - Converted monetary values to precise double type.
   - Analyzed and handled null values, removing them when necessary.
   - Identified and filled gaps in the data, when applicable.
   - Checked the referential integrity between tables.
   - Performed joins between tables to create integrated data sets.

2. **Data Modeling:**
   - Developed a data model that met the challenge requirements.
   - Created calculated measures to extract specific information from the data.
   - Established relationships between tables to facilitate analysis.
   - Organized data hierarchically for easy visualization.

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Used Power BI to create interactive visualizations.
   - Selected the following types of charts to represent the data:
     - Pie Chart: to show the gender distribution among employees.
     - Bar Chart: to show the count of employees per department.
     - Line Chart: to show the variation in hours worked on projects over time.
     - Funnel Chart: to show the number of candidates at each stage of the recruitment process.

**Results:**
The data was successfully treated and modeled according to the provided guidelines. The visualizations created in Power BI allow a clear and intuitive understanding of the data, facilitating the identification of relevant insights. The selected charts were effective in conveying the desired information and provided an accurate visual representation of the data.

**Conclusion:**
Data analysis using Power BI was used as a powerful tool to transform raw data into actionable insights. By following the steps of data handling and modeling, informative visualizations were created that assist in making informed decisions. The combination of selected charts was effective in communicating the necessary information clearly and concisely.

**Case Study:**
To illustrate the practical application of this process, consider the following scenario: A technology company wanted to analyze the performance of its projects over time and identify areas for improvement in resource management. Using Power BI, the data on hours worked on projects was treated, modeled, and visualized in a line chart. This allowed the company to identify resource allocation patterns, identify projects with tight deadlines, and take proactive measures to optimize workload distribution. As a result, the company was able to improve operational efficiency and allocate resources more effectively, resulting in projects completed on time and within budget.
